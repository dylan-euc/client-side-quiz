# Deploy to GitHub Pages
# 
# This workflow builds the Next.js static site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
# 
# Setup:
# 1. Go to repo Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"
# 2. Push to main branch to trigger deployment
# 
# If deploying to username.github.io/repo-name (not root):
# - Uncomment basePath and assetPrefix in next.config.ts
# - Set them to your repo name (e.g., '/client-side-quiz')
